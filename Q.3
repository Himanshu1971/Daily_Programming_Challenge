Merge Two Sorted Arrays

You are given two sorted arrays arr1 of size m and arr2 of size n. Your task is to merge these two arrays into a single sorted array without using any extra space (i.e., in-place merging). The elements in arr1 should be merged first, followed by the elements of arr2, resulting in both arrays being sorted after the merge.

Input:
Two sorted integer arrays arr1 of size m and arr2 of size n.
Example : 
arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]
arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]

Output:
Both arr1 and arr2 should be sorted after the merge. Since you cannot use extra space, the final result will be reflected in arr1 and arr2.
Example:
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
arr2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]

Constraints:
The arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order.
You must not use any extra space beyond a few variables (O(1) space complexity).
1 ≤ m, n ≤ 10^5.
1 ≤ arr1[i], arr2[j] ≤ 10^9.

Test Cases:
Test Case 1
Input: arr1 = [1, 3, 5], arr2 = [2, 4, 6]
Output: arr1 = [1, 2, 3], arr2 = [4, 5, 6]
Test Case 2:
Input: arr1 = [10, 12, 14], arr2 = [1, 3, 5]
Output: arr1 = [1, 3, 5], arr2 = [10, 12, 14]
Test Case 3:
Input: arr1 = [2, 3, 8], arr2 = [4, 6, 10]
Output: arr1 = [2, 3, 4], arr2 = [6, 8, 10]
Test Case 4:
Input: arr1 = [1], arr2 = [2]
Output: arr1 = [1], arr2 = [2]
Test Case 5:
Input: arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 100000], arr2 = [50001, ..., 100000]
Output: arr1 = [1, 2, 3, ..., 50000], arr2 = [50001, ..., 100000]

Edge Cases:
One or both arrays are already sorted in such a way that no swaps are needed.
One array is significantly smaller than the other.

Approach:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int arr1[5] = {1,3,5,7,9};
    int arr2[6] = {2,4,6,8,12,13};
    int n = 5,m = 6;
    
    int arr3[11];
    int i=0,j=0,k=0;
    
    while(i<n && j<m){
        if(arr1[i] < arr2[j]){
            arr3[k] = arr1[i];
            i++;
            k++;
        }else{
            arr3[k] = arr2[j];
            j++;
            k++;
        }
    }
    while(i<n){
        arr3[k] = arr1[i];
            i++;
            k++;
    }
    while(j<m){
         arr3[k] = arr2[j];
            j++;
            k++;
    }
    
    for(i=0;i<n+m;i++){
        cout<<arr3[i]<<" ";
    }
}
